ðŸ“šðŸ“¡ HTTP Apollo Link with batching & caching provided by dataloader.

## Idea

A Apollo Link that batches requests both in Node and the Browser.
You may ask what's the difference to [apollo-link-batch-http](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-link/tree/master/packages/apollo-link-batch-http).
Instead of having a time-frame/fixed cache size based batching approach like in `apollo-link-batch-http`, this library uses [dataloader](https://github.com/facebook/dataloader) for batching requests. It is a more generic approach just depending on the Node.JS event loop that batches all consecutive queries directly.
The main use-case for this library is the usage from a [`graphql-yoga`](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-yoga) server using [`prisma-binding`](https://github.com/graphcool/prisma-binding), but it can be used in any environment, even the browser as the latest `dataloader` version also runs in browser environments.

## Usage

```ts
import { HTTPLinkDataloader } from 'http-link-dataloader'

const link = new HTTPLinkDataloader()

const token = 'Auth Token'

const httpLink = new HTTPLinkDataloader({
  uri: `api endpoint`,
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` },
})
```

## Caching behavior

Note that the dataloader cache aggressively caches everything! That means if you don't want to cache anymore, just create a new instance of `BatchedHTTPLink`.
A good fit for this is every incoming HTTP request in a server environment - on each new HTTP request a new `BatchedHTTPLink` instance is created.

## Batching

This library uses array-based batching. Querying 2 queries like this creates the following payload:

```graphql
query {
  Item(id: "1") {
    id
    name
    text
  }
}
```

```graphql
query {
  Item(id: "2") {
    id
    name
    text
  }
}
```

Instead of sending 2 separate http requests, it gets combined into one:

```js
;[
  {
    query: `query {
      Item(id: "1") {
        id
        name
        text
      }
    }`,
  },
  {
    query: `query {
      Item(id: "2") {
        id
        name
        text
      }
    }`,
  },
]
```

**Note that the GraphQL Server needs to support the array-based batching!**
(Prisma supports this out of the box)

## Even better batching

A batching that would even be faster is alias-based batching. Instead of creating the array described above, it would generate something like this:

```js
{
  query: `
    query {
      item_1: Item(id: "1") {
        id
        name
        text
      }
      item_2: Item(id: "2") {
        id
        name
        text
      }
    }`
}
```

This requires a lot more logic and resolution magic for aliases, but would be a lot faster than the array based batching as our tests have shown!
